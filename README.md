# How to capture images:
  To capture the images for the training/testing process we will run the image capturing python notebook which will create a folder named data and create subfolders named from 0 to 9. The openCV window will save the picture to the proper folder as we press the key for the number. For e.g. in the openCV window if we press '1' then the camera will capture the image and save it in the subfolder named '1'.
